# Coin - The Virtual Stock Market

Coin is a virtual stock market. Everything about the shares on this market are real and up-to-date except the money. 
Users use virtual money to buy shares and get the same type of money when they sell them. 
Because the transactions and the money are not real, the users have nothing to earn or lose in real world.
